          Homework for Life is a journaling concept introduced by Matthew Dicks
          in his book "Storyworthy". I have implemented Homework for Life as a
          reminder that time keeps moving, and I need to remain aware of its
          passage. By writing a single sentence to remember each day, I become
          more mindful of the things I accomplish daily.
